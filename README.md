# RxJS-Intro
This boot camp is a follow on from the Asynchronous JavaScript boot camp. The learning focuses on the RxJS library
This library is huge, there is a lot to learn so in the boot camp we demonstrate how to get started with the basic parts of the library. Once you know how to set up your environment to accommodate the library, the rest is referencing the documentation and experimenting with the various operators.

Audience
Intermediate JavaScript programmers  with at least 4 years working experience. The second demographic for this boot camp is the group that have already taken the Asynchronous JavaScript boot camp mentioned above. This boot camp is only for JavaScript programmers.

Objectives:

•	After completing this boot camp participants would be aware of different environments for running RxJS library code
